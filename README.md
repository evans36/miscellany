This repository contains Python workflows that don't really fit in my other repositories, nor do they necessarily warrant repositories of their own. Currently, four Jupyter Notebooks are available, two for the atmospheric sciences: 
<ul>
  <li><b>TC Distance to Coast</b>, which demonstrates how open-source data and pandas/geopandas/shapely can be used to determine the distance of a tropical cyclone's track to the nearest coastline and identify the points along the track that are inland versus those that are over water.</li>
  <li><b>Vorticity and Divergence Inversion</b>, which demonstrates how model-derived relative-vorticity and divergence fields can be 'inverted' to obtain the components of the horizontal wind field that are uniquely associated with the partitioned relative vorticity and divergence.</li>
</ul>

And two mostly unrelated to the atmospheric sciences:
<ul>
  <li><b>Faculty Alma Maters</b>, which parses data from a <i>Nature</i> publication regarding where university faculty received their terminal degrees. Basic statistics for those in the atmospheric and related sciences are provided.</li>
  <li>2021 American Community Survey Data</b>, focusing on documenting the states from which people move to Wisconsin and the ages at which they do so, albeit (currently) without considering net migration (i.e., only considering those coming to Wisconsin).</li>
</ul>

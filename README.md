# miscellany

This repository contains Python workflows that don't really fit in my other repositories, nor do they necessarily warrant repositories of their own. Currently, two Jupyter Notebooks are available: 
<ul>
  <li><b>TC Distance to Coast</b>, which demonstrates how open-source data and pandas/geopandas/shapely can be used to determine the distance of a tropical cyclone's track to the nearest coastline and identify the points along the track that are inland versus those that are over water.</li>
  <li><b>Vorticity Inversion</b>, which demonstrates how a model-derived relative vorticity field can be 'inverted' to obtain the component of the horizontal wind field that is uniquely associated with the partitioned relative vorticity.</li>

# miscellany

This repository contains Python workflows that don't really fit in my other repositories, nor do they necessarily warrant repositories of their own. Currently, one Jupyter Notebook is available, which demonstrates how open-source data and pandas/geopandas/shapely can be used to determine the distance of a tropical cyclone's track to the nearest coastline and identify the points along the track that are inland versus those that are over water.

    "We wish to read in the edge-lists.csv file. When subset for the Field (TaxonomyLevel) of Atmospheric Sciences and Meteorology (TaxonomyValue), these data indicate the counts of faculty at each surveyed institution from a given alma mater; e.g., a Total of 2 for MIT from UWM would indicate that two faculty at UWM received their PhD from MIT.\n",

    "<b>Note</b>: I did a spot check on a DegreeInstitutionName of 'University of Arizona,' which returned Purdue as having seven Arizona alumni and Arizona having six of their own alumni on the faculty. These counts, particularly for Arizona, only make sense if the broadest-possible definition of faculty is considered - meaning tenure-track and tenured faculty, research faculty, and instructional faculty. I also did a spot check on 'Florida State,' which returned Florida State as having eight of their own alumni on the faculty (which their website does not seem to support). The <i>Nature</i> paper indicates that only tenured and tenure-track faculty are included in their data, but I couldn't immediately reconcile the data under that definition."
